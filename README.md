# House Price Prediction - Model Comparison

## Description
This project compares multiple machine learning models for predicting house prices based on structured data. It utilizes various regression models and tracks their performance using **MLflow** for experiment management.

The models included:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- LightGBM Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor

## Features
- Handles missing data and performs feature engineering.
- Encodes categorical features and splits the dataset for training and validation.
- Compares model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
- Logs experiment parameters, metrics, and models in MLflow.
- Identifies and saves the best-performing model.
